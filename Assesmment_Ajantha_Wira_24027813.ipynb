Only transactions of books borrowed from our library and returned during the year of the transaction are valid.

    "It is a debated question to identify the most popular book.\n",

    "I have considered the following factors:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Most days borrowed:**\n",
    "- The most number of days could be a result of that one person borrowing and returning after a long period which is debatable that he even read it, maybe just forgotten or taking too long to read. That should be treated in a different category as a recovery of the item from the member or replace the book if it is held by one single person for too long. It should be excluded from any statistical reviews.\n",
    "- Or that book could be a highly valuable textbook or educational book. In that case, may be the same book wanted by many. We cannot say that without looking into the genre and the value of the item. A meaningful statistical evaluation can be done only with historical data for the book.\n",
    "- If we can categorize and use the 'genre' to identify the above condition in more complex details, may we can make better assumptions as there is no reason why someone is reading a novel for a year!\n",
    "\n",
    "**Most number times borrowed**\n",
    "- I assume the most corrected assumption could be the book which has the highest number of loan count with the second criteria as the length of the borrowed period. That indicates the demand and popularity.\n",
    "- More people are willing to borrow the book. That indicates it is more popular.  \n",
    "- We should consider the 'genre' in this case too, a textbook cannot be returned that quickly but a novel can be. So if a textbook indicates a high number of loans it could be a bad book if returned in a shorter period.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Conclusion**\n",
    "- The statistics and one book are not enough.\n",
    "- Needed several years of statistical data to evaluate any meaningful conclusion if the library has only a single book.\n",
    "- We have to consider in both occasions 'genre' to come to a decision.\n",
    "- It can be even more accurate if we score all three elements (days_borrowed, number_times_borrowed, genre) together to get a better picture. If we can categorize, standardize and score them will give a better picture of the popularity.\n",
    "- Taking the factors I can weigh more to the side of **a number of times** loaned out for the popularity ranking.\n",
    "  \n",
    "**Note** The assumption could be more accurate and with less trouble if we had data for reservation requests for a single book which indicates the book is in demand. \n",
    "\n",
    "So, the library should introduce ***'a reservation request'*** method rather than both methods at the top as a prime selective method."

    "### **Conclusion:**\n",
    "I tried to cover and include most of the aspects of the assessment as learning in the process of doing so. Certain, different ways of presentations I tried here although they are not in the scope of the assessment. Learning with dictionaries was very valuable and interesting as it is very powerful in data handling, the same as tuples. They are challenging to handle as well. Some techniques I learned new as hit and try. I extensively used user-defined functions where possible, which gave me clarity in calculations, multiple uses, a lot easier troubleshooting, and a clean sheet in the main body. It helped me to modify the functions very often without affecting the overall result or getting mixed up as I had to focus only on a smaller portion of the whole project. Most of the functions have been developed to this stage after multiple modifications.\n",
    "\n",
    "Such assignments are very valuable in learning as the most difficult part is the application of the learning materials. Going forward I believe such case studies are very valuable. If we can add such works to our portfolio would be great if we are allowed to do so. The biggest benefit of such assessment I gained was using predefined functions where possible and keeping a clean main body, obviously in research and application.\n",
    "\n",
    "Completing the assignment I have followed the following points:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Using functions for most of the operations.\n",
    "- Used Docstrings in every function. That way helped me to provide the necessary documentation for each operation.\n",
    "- Used comments in most places.\n",
    "- Used Jupyter markdown section to provide additional information, chapter divisions and task references etc. This additional information will help me to study the assignment after a later period without any other documentation or use this as for personal portfolio or any one to understand how it was done.\n",
    "- Where needed for every requirment data sheets, calculations, reports are generated on the screen to verify the functions.\n",
    "  \n",
    "**Data Quality:** \n",
    "  \n",
    "***Note:*** In the given limited time completing, testing and troubleshooting this assessment there could be unintentionally missed requirements, wrong calculations or wrong assumptions, I would be glad to correct them if required.\n",
    "Thank you.  "

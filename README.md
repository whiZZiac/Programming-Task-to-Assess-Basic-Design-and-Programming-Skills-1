# Air Quality Data Analysis (2015-2020) - India

This project analyzes air quality data in India from 2015 to 2020 to understand trends, identify factors impacting air quality, and develop predictive models for AQI levels.

## Project Structure

- **Introduction**: Overview of the project goals, including predicting air quality index (AQI) values and identifying critical pollutants.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Handling missing values, detecting outliers, and normalizing data.
- **Feature Engineering**: Selecting important features based on correlation analysis.
- **Modeling**: Implementation of regression and classification models, including LSTM for time-series forecasting.
- **Results**: Evaluation of models based on performance metrics and visualization of findings.

## Requirements

The project utilizes Python with libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, and TensorFlow. All necessary packages are listed in the requirements.txt file.

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Run each cell in the Jupyter Notebook to reproduce the analysis.

## Conclusion

This analysis highlights significant factors affecting air quality in India, such as PM2.5 and PM10 levels, providing insights for further research and policy-making.
